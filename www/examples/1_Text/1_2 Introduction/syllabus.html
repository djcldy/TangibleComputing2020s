    <h2> Course Description </h2>

    <p>
        <b>‘Tangible Computing’</b> explores the evolving state of computation as both a visual and embodied medium. Through projects and daily work, students will cultivate an informed use of technology from the ground up; embracing both the precision and messiness of computers to generate unexpected, innovative, and multi-sensory user experiences and design artifacts. This knowledge will also help students develop deeper insights into emerging aesthetic principles and cultivate algorithmic literacy; the ability to recognize the biases inherent today in all digital interactions.
    </p>
    <p>
        The goal of many professional tools is to save time; providing capabilities to automate tasks such as clicking, dragging, animating ect.. With each release, these tools become more complex and also obsolete. However, the focus on such tools neglects the power of working with lower-level computation as a medium of creativity. As a DIDI Multimedia Design you are no different than the furniture design student who must learn how build at least a single chair by learning to cut  wood, stretch leather, and to also sit on it to see how it works. In this course you will learn how to <b>'build your own'</b>.
    </p>

        This course is split into two parts. The first part, ‘Decoding Cultures of Time-based Media”, focuses on screen-based interactions. It exposes the skills to create an interactive computer program and unpacks various visual cultures of computational aesthetics. The second part of the course, ‘Ambient Media Interfaces’, focuses on embodied interactions. It explores how to create mixed-reality and tangible media applications.

    <h2> Learning Objectives </h2>

    <ul  style="list-style-type:disc;">

      <li> 
        Evidence confidence with using a broad range of examples from new media art and interactive  technology to understand how they interrelate
      </li>
      <li>
        Evidence confidence with developing a repertoire to interpret things traditionally categorized either as software or as hardware where one can perceive the influence of the other
      </li>
      <li> 
        Evidence confidence with gaining experience and giving and receiving peer-group critique regarding how one expresses and instantiates one’s ideas.
      </li>
      <li> 
        Evidence competence in working with a variety of software technologies and using creative problem solving to generate multi-sensory affordances. 
      </li>

    </ul>

    <br>
