			<h1> Project One Decoding Cultures of Time-based Media </h1>

			<h2> Description </h2>
			
			<p> In my final project I stressed on the elements of Studio Ghibli animation that included immersive realism, run cycle sequences, Fantasy and the coming of age medium. 

					<br>
					<br>

					The first thing every single Studio Ghibli film does is to establish the veracity of its world, even if that world is drastically different from our own. The distinct Ghibli style and the fervent attention to detail Miyazaki and his animators employ help to make even the most fantastical realms real, they create a tactile link to the world we already know, and allow us to make the imaginative leap while barely noticing the transition. It’s a fine balance and not one every storyteller can strike so directly every time (Horton and Horton, 2014). 
	<br>
					<br>


The studio house’s style is never purely realistic nor fantastical and so I used time to be the main interaction element between the user and my sketch. The camera captures the movement of the user every minute and draws the growth of a flower that adds a petal every second. This resembles the element of immersive realism that strikes a difficult balance between fantasy and reality.  

	<br>
	<br>

I used functions to create a constant loop for the growth of the flowers and create capture to capture the movements of the user. The flower grows up to one minute with up to 60 petals to represent each second.The addition of petals every second causes the flower to look like it’s growing and therefore establishes the action of blooming which contributes to the coming of age element in every Studio Ghibli film. 

	<br>
	<br>

The story behind my sketch lies in the studio’s love for growth and the coming of age medium in which I used time to depict the growth and multiplication of the flowers.  

	<br>
	<br>

	Rather than focusing on recreating scenes from the studio with its visual elements and interaction dynamics, I've allowed the visual elements and interaction dynamics to inspire the project. 

	<br>
	<br>

	The studio takes the rules of our world and bend or break them however they wish. That’s part of the magic of animation. But to achieve a level of immersive realism, there must exist an underlying familiarity with the agents and the world where the story takes place. That familiarity comes from the details (Isbrucker, 2017). 

	<br>
	<br>


The progress I’ve made with processing throughout each week helped me develop deeper insights into emerging aesthetic principles and build algorithmic literacy.
