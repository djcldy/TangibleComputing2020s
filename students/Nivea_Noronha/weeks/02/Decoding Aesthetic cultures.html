Studio Ghibli is the Japanese animation powerhouse, has cast its spell over wide-eyed anime audiences across four decades. Hayao Miyazaki the creator of studio Ghibli and believes in making the character’s emotions yours by the studio house’s major asset “immersive realism”(Cafolla, 2016).

Striking a balance between fantasy and reality is difficult, and something major animators aside from Ghibli strive to create. “Every visual element in the film must be created from scratch, there’s nothing there before it’s drawn. “Their animators demonstrate a mastery of technique and attention to detail with every single scene, to really bring the world of the storyteller’s mind to life.” So, no matter how far-fetched the story, the world of a Ghibli film “feels tactile and realistic” (Cafolla, 2016).

 

 

 

Hayao Miyazaki’s art style is unique, distinct and combines both Japanese (anime/manga) and American animation together. Many of his films are diversely stylized, mainly due to the fact that Miyazaki traveled to many different places as a child.  He uses a mix of innovative animation techniques to produce amazing landscapes, scenery, and environmentalism (Cafolla, 2016).

 <br>
 

The studio house’s style is never purely realistic nor fantastical. It is always consistent in its animation style and the characters never have proportional human like features (Cafolla, 2016).</p>
