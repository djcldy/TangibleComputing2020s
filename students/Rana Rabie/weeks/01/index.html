			<h2> Summary </h2>
			
			<p> What really peaked my interest into studying multimedia was when I was able myself to create something out of a bunch of numbers and simple coding. It was quite hard and overwhelming in the start, but with practice and a drive to learn and not quit, I was able to produce a great outcome. I would love to maybe work more on AI and what we can achieve with it with our own ideas, I also would like to maybe develop further into our app drafts, just get more into the coding language too. Understanding coding language thoroughly. Time management is one of my biggest fears because I can very easily get distracted instead of doing my work. </p>
