		<h2> Discussion </h2>
		
		<p> The inspiration behind this project is structured "creative chaos." From observing nature on a surface level it seems most things are in a state of constant disarray, however, if you paid more attention to it you will find order amongst the chaos. The complexities of this natural order are what I want to explore in an abstract almost otherworldly manner, to see how far I can push the limits of my imagination. I expect the following weeks to be a challenge and it's one I shall gladly welcome. </p>
