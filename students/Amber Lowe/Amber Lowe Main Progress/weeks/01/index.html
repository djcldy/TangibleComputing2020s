			<p> I'm intrigued by multimedia design for several reasons the main ones being interaction design and development of UI/UX interfaces. App and website making is really fun and filled with endless possibilities. Skills I would love to explore are Web Graphic Design and Web Flow. Last semester we worked on building a concept for an application. Mine was based on travel and how we could potentially connect it to emerging technologies such as AR, VR or other digital and mixed realities. So far as burning projects go I don't have a complete set plan of what to do. I'm more invested in exploring ideas and learning as much as I can. The inspiration behind this project is structured "creative chaos." From observing nature on a surface level it seems most things are in a state of constant disarray, however, if you paid more attention to it you will find order amongst the chaos. The complexities of this natural order are what I want to explore in an abstract almost otherworldly manner, to see how far I can push the limits of my imagination. I expect the following weeks to be a challenge and it's one I shall gladly welcome. I hope to create a synthesis of nature's place in our current concrete jungles, exploring ideas of fictional cultures or worlds. Exploring dystopian or utopian themes to build a world and it's patterns aesthetics, time frames and realities. By the end of this, I hope to create a project that realizes the full potential of what could be an enticingly new and vivid digital experience. My biggest fear for this course is latency wherein my project reaches a state a stagnancy. As long as I keep learning, improving and creating new ideas and challenges for myself I believe I can make it through this course.  </p>
