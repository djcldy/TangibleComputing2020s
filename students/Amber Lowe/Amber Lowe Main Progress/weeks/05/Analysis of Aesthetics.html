Cyberpunk
<br>
In analysing the cyberpunk aesthetic I found something quite compelling about the rebellious attitude it invoked. When I did a bit of research I found that this rebelliousness set the bar for other works to follow such as steampunk, dieselpunk, vaporwave, and cybergoth. The pioneers of this aesthetic Philip K. Dick, Roger Zelazny, J. G. Ballard, Philip Jose Farmer, and Harlan Ellison all began to analyse the effect of drug culture and technology, bringing to life the hyper-futuristic neon lights staple of the cyberpunk genre. The aesthetic also focuses on a dystopian world, whereas at the time (1980's) themes for the future usually included an optimistic viewpoint to a utopian future, this set it apart from the norm.
Examples of media following this aesthetic include Ghost in the Shell, Blade Runner, The Matrix, Neuromancer, Black Mirror, to name a few.
