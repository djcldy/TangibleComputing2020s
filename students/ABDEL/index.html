		<p> Going into the Multimedia courses in DIDI, I initially had a tunnel view kind of mindset on wanting to put out my concepts and ideas into the digital screens to create an art performance that breaks through the screen itself. What I did not realize are the differences between the process of creating a piece of art my original way, and in the digital way. As my biggest fear came to reality; dealing with codes. It is a shock indeed having to work lines of letters, numbers, and symbols to create visuals, and getting to see the endless complex possibilities these lines can do. So, to overcome this confusion that I always had towards the process of creating a digital piece of work, I decide to look back at what got me into loving multimedia in the first place; video games. It all started with Nintendo classics like Super Mario Bros, and currently with the modern classic of a franchise that is Bayonetta; from the Italian plumber, to the angels-hunting witch. I am aiming to create an interactive installation project that allows the users to play an arcade-like game with 2D features, yet breaking through the two-dimensional limit using unconventional methods. Classic arcade feel of the Super Mario Bros. franchise, with the multi-level visuals and concepts of the Bayonetta franchise would be my main source of inspiration here. I can see using light projectors casted onto a specific kind of textured surface to display the gameplay experience, all controlled with an original Nintendo controller that -truly- started it all. As it is all scattered conceptual points yet to be tied together, I think it is safe to say that it is aimed to be a climax of what started the special video gaming feel shot over the canvas the user interacts with. </p>
