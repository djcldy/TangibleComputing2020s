			<h1> Week Two </h1>
			
			<hr>

			<h2> Summary </h2>
			
			<p> This week we were tapping more into the possibilities of visuals-creating with codes. As a self-reflection, it was still a bit odd and unpractical the concept of having to create visuals in this new age with letters, numbers, and symbols. But it is interesting regardless to create visuals with these simple non-visual elements other than the typical drop-and-drag design software format. Through all seven days of the week we experimented with creating images that included a ten thousand of whatever type of elements. Circles, squares, triangles, lines, or even letters! It was hard to image how the final outcomes actually included ten thousand of these very specific elements in our codes. Alongside that, we were also asked to research a type of aesthetic we like, and showcase its visual and interaction elements, as we may as well mainly continue with this type of aesthetic through the rest of the course. And this was my golden chance to express my obsession, I would say even, with Bayonetta. </p>

		<p> The entirety of Bayonetta is a constant climax, which should be a normal theme for a hack & slash type of game. A five hundred years old witch who uses her hair, or wicked weaves, to summon infernal demons and dance her way through the angels hunts; in her true fashion of heels guns, alongside her hands guns, of course. The game almost acts as a biography for the witch herself, showcasing her campy, over the top, unintentional sexual humor, with the apparent theme of religious in there. That also implies in the players intended gameplay plan; more style, more power. The combat system acts as an aesthetic element of itself, where it only earns you more points going forward if you challenge yourself to do the most stylish combos, which Bayonetta always ends with a special taunt; like blowing a kiss to a dead angel back as she summons her demons to drag them back to hell through a portal.. but stylishly! No matter how big or terrifying the bosses that she approaches are, it never seemed to be a problem to her. As after their arrival cutscene ends, the elegant jazzy soundtrack of hers starts playing for her to hunt that angel, which she makes it look like a dance. <p>
<p>As she says, as long as there is music, she will keep on dancing.
