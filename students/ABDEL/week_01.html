		<h2> Discussion </h2>
		
		<p> In this first week we were asked to use the template given to create our own website, on which we will be documenting our journey through this course. Just like this current page, it started by creating other fifteen pages to resemble the total of sixteen weeks we have in this current semester. Each would showcase the weekly work we do to end up with a fully personalized website of the course’s project through its sixteen weeks, including the homepage which presents our initial reflection of the course, and our goal project for it. It was, like I mentioned before, really scary at first having to work with the coding language. Started with looking at codings of easy and simple websites to understand how these lines turn into the content that creates a website, that did help a lot. I made my way through from the simplest codes of creating a header or a bio and so, to what seemed like the most complex code I got to experience at the moment; adding sound! Just playing around with the colors codes and so, I finally decided to add the -retro version- of an iconic song from the Bayonetta’s soundtrack; Mysterious Destiny. Seemed like it goes along with the arcade concept of my goal project. </p>
