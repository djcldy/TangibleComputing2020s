			The game was inspired by the most successful game in video game history, which is my favourite childhood game, Super Mario. After 30 years of Mario game release, it remains a timeless and reference game for past and present games in the market despite the simplicity of the game. The game I designed has multiple features in common with the old super Mario game in terms of visual elements and the interaction dynamics. The visual elements I used for this game are; simple graphics made of circles, rectangles and squares, basic animations and colourful open screen that display the whole game in one visible screen. The interaction dynamics of the game; including the movements were programmed using the rule of physics, and this includes random horizontal and vertical movement of the collectable items, the main character jumping feature, a score counter and the classic background Mario theme music.
The game consists of the main character which is Mario face, random flowers to the collect, landscaped background including apple trees, mountains, moving clouds and sun as well as timed score counter display and 3 life monkeys for Mario. The main idea of the game is simple where there is a screen that displays random moving flowers in different directions, where Mario can jump to collect as many flowers as possible to get the maximum score points before the time finish.I started designing the game by drawing each character and graphics in the game from scratch using javascript language. I drew most of the game elements using basic shapes such as triangles, rectangles, circles and squares. Secondly, I worked on the animation part and how each character can move and act in the game using several javascript commands such as function, array, variables, speed, colour, class, push, pop, translate and many more in my sketch. The main character which is Mario took a lot of time to give him certain behaviours such as moving and jumping, on the other hand, the collectable flowers were challenging as well as it supposes to move randomly back and forth on the screen. 
The third step was to make a connection between Mario, flowers and the score counter; this step was a challenging and time-consuming process, especially for someone with little experience in coding. Finally, I started to refine all game elements and to draw multiple features on the background such as mountains, trees, sun and green roads beside adding the classic super Mario theme song to complete the overall game seen.Despite the simplicity of the game, the coding took two months to finish, but I learned so much coding during this period that made me thrived and motivated to learn more coding and develop this game further in the future.
It is just the beginning :)
