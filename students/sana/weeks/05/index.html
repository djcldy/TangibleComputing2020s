			<h2> Project One: Mario The Frog Game  </h2>

		

			</p>
			The game was inspired by the most successful game in video game history, which is my favourite childhood game,</p> Super Mario. 

After 30 years of Mario game release, it remains a timeless and reference game for past and present </p>games in the market despite the simplicity of the game. The game I designed has multiple features in common with </p>the old super Mario game in terms of visual elements and the interaction dynamics. The visual elements I used for</p> this game are; simple graphics made of circles, rectangles and squares, basic animations and colourful open </p>screen that display the whole game in one visible screen. The interaction dynamics of the game; including the </p>movements were programmed using the rule of physics, and this includes random horizontal and vertical movement </p>of the collectable items, the main character jumping feature, a score counter and the classic background </p>Mario theme music.
The game consists of the main character which is Mario face, random flowers to  collect, </p>landscaped background including apple trees, mountains, moving clouds and sun as well as timed score </p>counter display and 3 life monkeys for Mario. The main idea of the game is simple where there is a screen that </p>displays random moving flowers in different directions, where Mario can jump to collect as many flowers as possible </p>to get the maximum score points before the time finish.I started designing the game by drawing each character and </p>graphics in the game from scratch using javascript language. I drew most of the game elements using basic shapes </p>such as triangles, rectangles, circles and squares. Secondly, I worked on the animation part and how each character</p> can move and act in the game using several javascript commands such as function, array, variables, speed,colour,</p> class, push, pop, translate and many more in my sketch. The main character which is Mario took a lot of time to give</p> him certain behaviours such as moving and jumping, on the other hand, the collectable flowers were challenging </p>as well as it supposes to move randomly back and forth on the screen. The third step was to make a connection </p>between Mario, flowers and the score counter; this step was a challenging and time-consuming process,</p> especially for someone with little experience in coding. Finally, I started to refine all game elements and to draw </p>multiple features on the background such as mountains, trees, sun and green roads beside adding the classic super</p> Mario theme song to complete the overall game seen.Despite the simplicity of the game, the coding took two months </p>to finish, but I learned so much coding during this period that made me thrived and motivated to learn more </p>coding and develop this game further in the future.</p> Thank you Sajel for the help with this project</p>

It is just the beginning :)
