			<h2> Super Mario Game</h2>
			<p> Super Mario game was one of the video game most successful in the '80s. The game design is really simple since the main idea behind the game is to get from the start of the stage to the end. The game's visual elements are very basic including the player, creatures like turtles, happy faces, blue sky, capsule-like background shapes, green terrains, brown under the ground surface, square obstacles with different heights, coins and display for collecting coins. The gameplay mechanics are very simple and this includes; the player can leap, move backwards, forwards and slide down, the creatures can move only left and right and the coins rotate only. Despite the simplicity of the game design and animations; super Mario game success proved that "difficulty doesn't equal greatness  " because people still playing and enjoying the game even with all the advanced video games in the market.</p>
