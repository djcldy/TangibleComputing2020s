			<h2>  Decoding Aesthetic Cultures  </h2>
			<h2> Super Mario Game</h2>
			<p> Super Mario game was one of the most scuccesful video games in the '80s.
				The game design is <p>really simple since the main idea behind the game is to get from the start of the stage to the end.<p> The game consists of very basic elements such as ;the player, creatures like turtles, happy faces, blue sky,<p> capsule-like background shapes, green terrains, under ground surface, square obstacles with different <p>heights, coins and display for collecting coins. The gameplay mechanics are very simple and this includes;<p> the player can leap, move backwards, forwards and slide down, the creatures can move only left and <p>right and the coins rotate only. Despite the simplicity of the game design and animations; super Mario <p>game success proved that "difficulty doesn't equal greatness " because people still playing and enjoying<p> the game even with all the advanced video games in the market.</p>
