			<h2> Website Exploration </h2>
			
			<p> This week we have been introduced to the course objectives and the big ideas behind it. We are learning about the basics of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and we started to create a personal website. 
			 In the beginning; it was challenging and intimidating idea for me to create a website from scratch because it was hard to figure out the right tools to set up my website, but with practice and research I managed to come up with decent website design. It's been fun and exciting, and I look forward to updating my page every day and adding more and more creative stuff like photos and animations.</p>

			 Stay tuned for more fun stuff :)</p>
