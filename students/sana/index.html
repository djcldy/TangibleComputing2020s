I believe that self-description is just a perception' so it is changed a person by person, I am sharing with you what I think about me and my goals in life, but it can be different than how you or others see me.   
My name is Sana, married and a mother for two beautiful children. I born and raised in Sudan then moved to Dubai 8 years ago, living in a foreign country is challenging, but being with different people has influenced me into appreciating different cultures and beliefs. I am a doctor, I have MBBS in medicine and MSC in haemoglobinopathy. I believe that “Nothing is Impossible”, because I had a major milestone in my career, shifting from being a doctor to a designer, what a mind-blowing journey I decided to start at DIDI. I am very fortunate to have the courage to change my career and follow my passion in design because many people still don't understand the importance of accepting who they are or do what they are passionate about in life.  
    Art, product and multimedia design are my passion in life. I am passionate about almost anything visually appealing, and I consider myself a "visual learner". Without a doubt; passion is the secret recipe for success, and this what I discovered about myself in DIDI university and I didn't experience in my previous carrier or universities.   
I am eager to succeed in my design career path, learning more about design, and mixing product design with the multimedia design will complete for me all the pieces of the puzzle I need to establish my new carrier.My biggest goal from studying multimedia is to learn about advanced technologies such as AI and AR, get the maximum knowledge about Arduino programming and generative art and this will tremendously help me with my future goal as a product designer who wants to combine technology with products. 
All these multimedia course expectations come with a lot of concerns such as time management of assignments as learning coding can be daunting and requires a lot of time and dedication. I am very optimistic and so excited about this course and can't wait to start this exciting and challenging journey. <p>  
 
 
Stay tuned for my future crazy creations ;)  </p>

Note: The image is for the digital artists Nguyen Thanh Nhan, and it's named "CRY ME A RIVER" somehow, I believe this digital art is portraying me and I want to use coding to create amazing digital art and portraits by the end of this course. <p>
